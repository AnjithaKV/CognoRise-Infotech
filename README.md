# Task 1 - Iris Flower Classification
Iris flower classification is a common task in the field of machine learning, often used as a beginner's example due to its simplicity and effectiveness in demonstrating classification algorithms. The goal of iris flower classification is to classify iris flowers into one of three species: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, or Iris-virginica, based on measurements of their sepal and petal dimensions.
The dataset typically used for iris flower classification contains 150 samples of iris flowers, with 50 samples for each of the three species. Each sample includes four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. These features serve as the input variables for the classification model
Machine learning algorithm, k-nearest neighbors was trained on the iris dataset to learn patterns and relationships between the input features and the target classes. Once trained, the model can predict the species of iris flower for new, unseen data based on its feature measurements.
Iris flower classification serves as an introductory exercise for understanding the workflow of a machine learning project, including data preprocessing, model training and evaluation. It also provides a foundation for exploring more complex classification tasks and algorithms in the future.

# Task 2 - Titanic Survival Prediction
This project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during its maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, resulting in the deaths of a large number of passengers and crew. By analyzing various factors such as passenger demographics, ticket class,etc., we aim to build a predictive model to determine the likelihood of survival for individual passengers.
Employed Support Vector Machines (SVM) as the predictive model.

Tools Used:
1) Python programming language
2) Libraries such as pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and seaborn for data manipulation, analysis, visualization, and machine learning.
The performance of the predictive model was assessed based on metrics such as accuracy, precision and recall.
The Titanic survival prediction project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to a real-world problem. By analyzing historical data and building predictive models, we gain insights into factors influencing survival rates aboard the Titanic. This project also serves as a learning opportunity to understand data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation processes in machine learning projects.
